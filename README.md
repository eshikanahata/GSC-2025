Next steps:
1. fix the transliteration code and push the transliterated versions of all datasets (_0 is for train _1 is for validation, didnt include test as it was unlabelled)
2. research on ways to fix class imbalance and implement it
3. find the most appropriate tokenization and encoding method for pre trained model being used and apply it
4. upload those datasets as well and train sota models (indicBERT, indicBART, RoBERTa etc. use a google model please)
